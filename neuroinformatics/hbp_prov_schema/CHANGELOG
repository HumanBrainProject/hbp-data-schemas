### Whole schema changes
* additional properties are now not allowed anywhere in the schema
* added new directory structure
* added examples/tests

#### Removed fields
* /representations/represented_entities is removed because we never used it and not fully understand what it really means

* dates in /activities are not mandatory anymore
* both agent and role made mandatory in the agent-role pair
* we support just 3 atlases in the /datasets/atlas_location/atlas_template
* we added checksums for /representations and /datasets/documentation_files. MD5 and SHA-1 are supported now
