## [3.0-RC3] 2016-01-07 Samuel Kerrien / Lomig MÃ©gard / Catherine Zwahlen / Yuri Katkov

### Updated fields
* 'schema_version' enum now has only the following value: "3.0"
* All fields representing a UUID, previously typed as #/definitions/uuid are now defined as "type":"string", "format":"uuid"
  That way we do not have to maintain our own regex (which was wrong anyway since typically the accepted character set is 0-9a-Z)
* All fields representing dates, previously typed as #/definitions/date_optional_MM_DD are now defined as "type":"string", "format":"date" so we do not have to maintain our own regex. 
* All fields representing emails with hand crafted regex, are now defined as "type":"string", "format":"email" and will be validated as per the schema specification against RFC 5322, section 3.4.1.
* 'registration.data_providers': instead of defining the providers, we now only have a list of identifiers that should take their values in 'agents.contributors', 'agents.organisations' or 'agents.software'. This list of identifiers does not allow for duplicates.
* Renamed 'activities.agents.id' to 'activities.agents.agent_ref' to clarify that this is a reference to an existing agent UUID.
* Renamed activities.protocol to activities.protocol_description and its type has changes from a single ontology_term to free text where a submitted can describe the protocol used. This field is now optional and the hbp-prov-validator will make sure that at least one protocol_description or method is present.
* Added activities.methods is an optional array of ontology_term
* Renamed all attribute 'generation' to 'activity_ref'
* Changed the type of 'dataset.atlas_location.atlas_template' from an enum to an ontology term so that we do not require a schema change when adding a atlas templates.
* some fields in address of resourse become mandatory
