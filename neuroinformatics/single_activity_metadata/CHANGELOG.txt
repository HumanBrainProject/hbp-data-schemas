## [1.0-RC5] 2016-02-24 Yuri Katkov
### Added fields
-  dataset.protocol.designer and dataset.protocol.publication_doi and dataset.protocol.publication_pubmed
-  registration.agreement.timestamp and registration.agreement.version . We need this field to know when exactly the user agreed with legal terms, so that we can show it as a proof.

### Removed fields
- removed the data_type field. Reason: the meeting with Sean, where he said it's not needed for one-click registration. Also it's hard to know the proper datatype if we have a zip folder full of different files.

### Others
- removed minItems constraint when the field is optional. 
- Gestation is replaced by Pre-natal
- protocol.name -> protocol.title to conform with hbpprov

## [1.0-RC4] 2016-02-24 Catherine Zwahlen / Yuri Katkov

- schema_version to specify the version in the SAM json file

## [1.0-RC3] 2016-02-03 Samuel Kerrien / Yuri Katkov

### Updated fields
- Updated file names to Single Activity Metadata (SAM)
- Updated javaType attributes to reflect java packages changes
- specimen.name is no longer a mandatory field (decision is made after the discussion with Sean 1.2.2016). The reason to make it optional is that we consider the name of the specimen to be an internal id of the lab, which is unnesessary to expose.  We also decided that the "search by specimen name" use case is not our priority.
- definitions/organisation/name is now the required field

#### Added fields
- dataset.protocol describes the protocol and its name with optional id in the database
- dataset.datatype is brought back. Probably it was removed by a mistake in the previous versions.
- registration/contributors/laboratory describes the laboratory (section, team, group) inside the organisation

#### Removed fields
- registration.description is removed because it has duplicated usage with dataset.description
- dataset.protocol_description is removed in favor to dataset.protocol (see Added fields)
